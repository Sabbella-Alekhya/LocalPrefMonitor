DESCRIPTION : A Performance Monitoring Dashboard is a powerful tool designed to provide real-time insights into the health and performance of computer systems, servers, or applications. The localperfmonitor project is a practical example of such a dashboard, which monitors system performance locally, enabling users or administrators to quickly assess and diagnose potential performance issues before they escalate into critical failures.
